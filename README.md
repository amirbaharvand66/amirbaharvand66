### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amir, a composite structural engineer who likes developing codes on solid mechanics, composite analysis and numerical modeling. I usually use Matlab and Python and also like Maple for symbolic operations. Sometimes I upload short documentation on the theoretical material behind my code. You may find them in the *report* folder of each repository.
